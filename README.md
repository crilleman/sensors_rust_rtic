# Sensors with Rust/RTIC
### SGP40 - Air quality sensor
### Analog MEMS microphone sensor
### digital MEMS microphone sensor
### MCP9804 - Temperature sensor
#### These sensors were implemented with Rust/RTIC and interfaced to the evaluation board NUCLEO-L412-RB-P.
#### The eval boards was programmed to output the sensor data via USART to a computers VCOM port running each respective python script.
#### The python scripts plots the seriell data continuously.
